## **2. Grammar: Simple Past Tense**

### 2.1 What is the Simple Past?
The Simple Past is a verb tense used to talk about actions or events that happened and were completed in the past.

### 2.2 Structure

**Affirmative:**  
<span class="texto-verde">Subject</span> + <span class="texto-vermelho">verb</span> (past form)  
*Example: I <span class="texto-vermelho">visited</span> my friend yesterday.*

**Negative:**  
<span class="texto-verde">Subject</span> + <span class="texto-azul">did</span> not (didn’t) + <span class="texto-vermelho">base form of the verb</span>  
*Example: I <span class="texto-azul">didn't</span> <span class="texto-vermelho">visit</span> my friend.*

**Interrogative:**  
<span class="texto-azul">Did</span> + <span class="texto-verde">subject</span> + <span class="texto-vermelho">base form of the verb</span>  
*Example: <span class="texto-azul">Did</span> you <span class="texto-vermelho">visit</span> your friend?*

### 2.3 Regular and Irregular Verbs

**Regular verbs** form the past tense by adding **-ed** to the base form.  
Examples:  
- play → played  
- work → worked  
- talk → talked

**Irregular verbs** do not follow a fixed pattern when changing to the past tense. You need to memorize their past forms.  
Examples:  
- go → went  
- have → had  
- eat → ate  
- see → saw

### 2.4 Suggested Practice
- Create a list of 10 regular verbs and 10 irregular verbs. Write one sentence in the past for each.
- Rewrite a short paragraph in the present tense into the past tense.
- Use flashcards or apps like Quizlet to study irregular verbs.
